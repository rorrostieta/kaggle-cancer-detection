# Kaggle Histopathologic Cancer Detection
Welcome to the project, this is my project submission for the [Histopathologic Cancer Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection) competition.

## Objective
The competition consists on correctly labeling a series of images which might contain pixels with cancerous cells, you can read more about the provided dataset on the competition page/

## The Model
This project is using convolutional neural networks with Python. I'm starting based on the [VGG-16 Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vgg-16-cnn-model/) doing some transfer learning and adding a couple additional layers to see the performance.

## Running the Code
If you're interested in running this code I recommend using the Kaggle kernel since GPUs that they offer are useful in order to run the CNN models semi-efficiently.

The data used can be obtained from the competition page and you can give it a shot and do the problem yourself.
